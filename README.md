# 📷 Camera Movement Detector

This project was developed as part of the **ATP Core Talent AI Coder Challenge 2025**.  
It is a Streamlit-based web application that analyzes uploaded videos and detects **significant camera movements** such as panning, tilting, or shaking.  
It does **not** focus on object motion — instead, it detects changes in the global scene indicating that the camera itself moved.

## 🎯 Features

- 📼 Upload a video (MP4, AVI, MOV)
- 🎞️ Extracts and analyzes frames
- 🎯 Detects significant camera movement (not object motion)
- 💡 Clean, modern UI with ATP branding

## 🧠 Approach

- **Frame Extraction:** Extracts all frames from the video using OpenCV.
- **Feature Detection & Matching:** ORB feature detector is used to compare consecutive frames.
- **Homography Transformation:** Calculates transformation matrix to estimate global scene shift.
- **Movement Decision:** If the transformation deviates above a threshold, it is classified as camera movement.
- **Bonus Logic:** Tries to filter out object motion by comparing matched keypoints and transformation consistency.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python 3.13**
- **OpenCV**
- **Streamlit** (for UI)
- **Datasets** from Hugging Face (for CameraBench demo data)
- **NumPy** for numerical processing
